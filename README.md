Customer Shopping Behavior Analytics
Overview

This project analyzes retail customer transaction data to uncover spending patterns, customer segments, revenue drivers, and subscription impact.

The objective is to transform raw transactional data into structured insights that support data-driven business decisions in marketing, customer engagement, and product strategy.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow:

Data preparation in Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL-based business analysis

Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

Executive report and presentation

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)

Purchase details (Item, Category, Season, Purchase Amount)

Behavioral indicators (Discount usage, Frequency, Shipping type, Review rating)

Key preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values in review ratings

Standardizing column names

Creating engineered features (age groups, purchase frequency)

Validating data consistency

Tools & Technologies

Programming & Data Processing

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn)

Database & Querying

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Structured business queries for segmentation and revenue analysis

Visualization

Power BI for interactive dashboarding

Reporting

Written analytical report summarizing insights

Presentation deck created using Gamma

Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Preparation (Python)

Imported dataset using pandas

Checked data types and summary statistics

Cleaned missing values

Standardized column naming

Engineered new analytical features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Revenue analysis by gender and age group

Purchase distribution across categories

Subscription vs non-subscription comparison

Discount usage behavior

Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

3. SQL Business Analysis

Data was loaded into a relational database and analyzed using SQL:

Revenue contribution by demographic segments

High-spending discount users

Top-rated and most purchased products

Subscription impact on repeat purchases

Shipping type influence on spending

4. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

An interactive dashboard was built to visualize:

Revenue by category

Revenue by age group

Subscription breakdown

Sales distribution

Average purchase metrics

The dashboard enables quick executive-level insight into customer behavior patterns.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

KPI cards (Total Customers, Avg Purchase Amount, Avg Rating)

Revenue segmentation visuals

Customer distribution by age group

Subscription comparison analysis

Category-wise performance overview

The dashboard is designed for business stakeholders to explore trends interactively.

Key Results

Identified revenue-driving customer segments

Quantified subscription impact on overall revenue

Detected high-value discount users

Highlighted top-performing product categories

Segmented customers into actionable groups

These insights support marketing optimization, customer retention strategy, and product positioning.

Report & Presentation
